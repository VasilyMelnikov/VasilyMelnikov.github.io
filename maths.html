I establish this basic result of Kummer theory using Galois cohomology, a cohomology theory for Galois modules.</p><p><a href="rh.html" class="otherlink">The Riemann hypothesis for function fields</a><br>Many of the tools of modern algebraic geometry were developed to solve the Weil conjectures, which are statements about the zeta function of an algebraic variety over a finite field. In particular, they assert the zeta function is rational, solves a certain functional equation, and satisfies an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. This article will examine and prove the third.</p><p><a href="op.html" class="otherlink">Operator algebraic approach to topology</a><br>Geometric objects are often studied by considering algebras of functions. In fact, the two approaches are often equivalent. In this blog post, I examine one such equivalence: a duality between commutative \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras and locally compact Hausdorff spaces. I then prove a result, first due to I. Gelfand and M. Naimark, connecting \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras to Hilbert spaces. This emphasizes the idea that the study of Hilbert spaces is in some sense a generalization of classical geometry.</p><p><a href="aws.html" class="otherlink">Cylinder set measures in mathematical physics</a><br>Assuming familiarity with L. Gross's theory of abstract Wiener spaces and the Cameron-Martin quasi-invariance theorem, I present an application of the aforementioned theory to mathematical physics. In particular, a rigorous interpretation of a special case of R. Feynman's path integral is given.</p></div><div class="toc"><a class="titlelink">Categories</a><p><a class="otherlinks">Math</a></p></div></div>
