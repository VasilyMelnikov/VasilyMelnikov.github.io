A \(G\)-module is an abelian group \(M\) together with a group action of \(G\) on \(M\) (which I will write multiplicatively, with the group operation of \(M\) written additively). Equivalently, a \(G\)-module is a module over the group ring \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\) of \(G\). This point of view will become useful later since the category of modules over a fixed ring has enough injectives (allowing one to form right derived functors). Consider the functor $$M\longmapsto M^{G},$$ $$M^{G}:=\{x\in M:g\cdot x=x\forall g\in G\}.$$ Elements of \(M^{G}\) are called \(G\)-invariants. Taking \(G\)-invariants is left-exact; it can fail to be right-exact in certain cases (intuitively, the action of \(G\) is less free on quotients). With this in mind, one can define the group cohomology functors \(H^{i}(\cdot,G)\) as the right derived functors of \(M\longmapsto M^{G}\).</div></div>
