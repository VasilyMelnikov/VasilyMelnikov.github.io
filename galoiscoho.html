A \(G\)-module is an abelian group \(M\) together with a group action of \(G\) on \(M\) (which I will write multiplicatively, with the group operation of \(M\) written additively). Equivalently, a \(G\)-module is a module over the group ring \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\) of \(G\). This point of view will become useful later since the category of modules over a fixed ring has enough injectives (allowing one to form right derived functors). Consider the functor $$M\longmapsto M^{G},$$ $$M^{G}:=\{x\in M:g\cdot x=x\forall g\in G\}.$$ Elements of \(M^{G}\) are called \(G\)-invariants. Taking \(G\)-invariants is left-exact; it can fail to be right-exact in certain cases (intuitively, the action of \(G\) is less free on quotients). With this in mind, one can define the group cohomology functors \(\{H^{i}(G,\cdot):i\in\mathbb{N}\}\) as the right derived functors of \(M\longmapsto M^{G}\). Although theoretically sufficient, this definition is not easy to compute (being based on injective resolutions). A more accessible definition is obtained by noticing there is an isomorphism $$M^{G}\simeq\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbf{Z},M)$$ where \(\mathbf{Z}\) is given the trivial \(G\)-action, and the Hom is taken in the category of \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\)-modules; this implies $$H^{i}(G,\cdot)\simeq\mathrm{Ext}^{i}_{\mathbf{Z}[G]}(\mathbf{Z},\cdot)$$ for all \(i\).<div class="thm"><div class="form"><span><strong>Lemma (Hilbert's theorem 90). </strong></span>Let \(L\) be a Galois extension of \(K\). Then \(H^{1}\left(\mathrm{Gal}(L/K),L^{\times}\right)=0\).</div></div><div class="prf"><div class="form"><span><strong>Proof. </strong>Let \(G\) be an arbitrary group. I will first construct the bar resolution of \(G\). Define \(P_{n}\) for integers \(n\geq 0\) inductively: \(P_{0}\) is the free \(\mathbf{Z}\)-module on the set \(G\), with \(P_{n+1}:=P_{n}\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}P_{0}\); set \(P_{-1}:=\mathbf{Z}\). \(P_{n}\) admits the structure of a \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\)-module, with action $$g\cdot(h_{0}\otimes\dots\otimes h_{n})=gh_{0}\otimes\dots\otimes gh_{n}.$$ The differential \(d_{n}:P_{n}\longrightarrow P_{n-1}\) is the map $$d_{n}(g_{0}\otimes\dots\otimes g_{n})=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(-1)^{i}g_{0}\otimes\dots\otimes g_{i}g_{i+1}\otimes\dots\otimes g_{n}.$$ One can verify $$\dots\to P_{1}\to P_{0}\to\mathbf{Z}\to 0$$ is long and exact where the connecting maps are the differentials. After applying the Hom functor and removing \(\mathbf{Z}\) from the resulting complex one obtains $$0\to \mathrm{Hom}(P_{0},M)\to \mathrm{Hom}(P_{1},M)\to \dots$$ where \(M\) is a given \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\)-module. Recalling the definition of the Ext functor and noting the original complex was a projective resolution of \(\mathbf{Z}\) yields an isomorphism between the \(i\)-th cohomology of the above complex and \(\mathrm{Ext}^{i}_{\mathbf{Z}[G]}(\mathbf{Z},M)\simeq H^{i}(G,M)\).<p>By the universal property of the group ring, each element of \(\mathrm{Hom}(P_{n},M)\) can be identified with a function in \(G^{n}\longrightarrow M\) where \(G^{0}\) is a singleton (presumably the identity, although it does not really matter), and vice-versa.</p></span></div></div></div></div>
