A \(G\)-module is an abelian group \(M\) together with a group action of \(G\) on \(M\) (which I will write multiplicatively). Equivalently, a \(G\)-module is a module over the group ring \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\) of \(G\). This point of view will become useful later since the category of modules over a fixed ring has enough injectives (allowing one to form right derived functors). Consider the functor $$M\longmapsto M^{G},$$ $$M^{G}:=\{x\in M:g\cdot x=x\forall g\in G\}.$$ Elements of \(M^{G}\) are called \(G\)-invariants. Taking \(G\)-invariants is left-exact; it can fail to be right-exact in certain cases (intuitively, the action of \(G\) is less free on quotients). With this in mind, one can define the group cohomology functors \(\{H^{i}(G,\cdot):i\in\mathbb{N}\}\) as the right derived functors of \(M\longmapsto M^{G}\). Although theoretically sufficient, this definition is not easy to compute (being based on injective resolutions). A more accessible definition is obtained by noticing there is an isomorphism $$M^{G}\simeq\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbf{Z},M)$$ where \(\mathbf{Z}\) is given the trivial \(G\)-action, and the Hom is taken in the category of \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\)-modules; this implies $$H^{i}(G,\cdot)\simeq\mathrm{Ext}^{i}_{\mathbf{Z}[G]}(\mathbf{Z},\cdot)$$ for all \(i\).<div class="thm"><div class="form"><span><strong>Lemma (Hilbert's theorem 90). </strong></span>Let \(L\) be a Galois extension of \(K\). Then \(H^{1}\left(\mathrm{Gal}(L/K),L^{\times}\right)=0\).</div></div><div class="prf"><div class="form"><span><strong>Proof. </strong>Let \(G\) be an arbitrary group. I will first construct the bar resolution of \(G\). Define \(P_{n}\) for integers \(n\geq 0\) inductively: \(P_{0}\) is the free \(\mathbf{Z}\)-module on the set \(G\), with \(P_{n+1}:=P_{n}\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}P_{0}\); set \(P_{-1}:=\mathbf{Z}\). \(P_{n}\) admits the structure of a \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\)-module, with action $$g\cdot(h_{0}\otimes\dots\otimes h_{n})=gh_{0}\otimes\dots\otimes gh_{n}.$$ The differential \(d_{n}:P_{n}\longrightarrow P_{n-1}\) is the map <span class="equation"><span class="eqn">$$d_{n}(g_{0}\otimes\dots\otimes g_{n})=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(-1)^{i}g_{0}\otimes\dots\otimes g_{i}g_{i+1}\otimes\dots\otimes g_{n}.$$</span></span> One can verify $$\dots\to P_{1}\to P_{0}\to\mathbf{Z}\to 0$$ is long and exact where the connecting maps are the differentials. After applying the Hom functor and removing \(\mathbf{Z}\) from the resulting complex one obtains $$\dots \leftarrow\mathrm{Hom}(P_{1},M)\leftarrow\mathrm{Hom}(P_{0},M)\leftarrow0$$ where \(M\) is a given \(\mathbf{Z}[G]\)-module. Recalling the definition of the Ext functor and noting the original complex was a projective resolution of \(\mathbf{Z}\) yields an isomorphism between the \(i\)-th cohomology of the above complex and \(\mathrm{Ext}^{i}_{\mathbf{Z}[G]}(\mathbf{Z},M)\simeq H^{i}(G,M)\).<p>Each element of \(\mathrm{Hom}(P_{n},M)\) can be identified in a canonical fashion with a function \(G^{n}\longrightarrow M\) where \(G^{0}\) is a singleton (presumably the identity, although it does not really matter), and vice-versa. Let \(d^{\ast}_{n}\) be the image of \(d_{n}\) under \(\mathrm{Hom}(\cdot,M)\). Call a function \(\varphi:G\longrightarrow M\) a \(1\)-cocycle if the corresponding element \(\xi(\varphi)\) of \(\mathrm{Hom}(P_{1},M)\) satisfies \(d^{\ast}_{2}\circ \xi(\varphi)=0\); denote by \(Z^{1}(G,M)\) the set of \(1\)-cocycles. Then one has <span class="equation"><span class="eqn">$$H^{1}(G,M)=0\iff \forall\varphi\in Z^{1}(G,M)\exists \psi\in\mathrm{Hom}(P_{0},M)\simeq M:\xi(\varphi)=d^{\ast}_{1}(\psi).$$</span></span> Thus it suffices to show the right hand side of the above equivalence for \(G=\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\), \(M=L^{\times}\).</p><span>Write \(L\rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\) for the crossed product algebra, which is the \(L\)-vector space generated by \(G\) endowed with the structure of a \(K\)-algebra with \(xgyh=x(g\cdot y)gh\) for \(x,y\in L\), \(g,h\in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\). All simple \(L\rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\)-modules are isomorphic; indeed, \(L\rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\) is simple as a \(K\)-algebra. Suppose \(\varphi:G\longrightarrow L^{\times}\) is a \(1\)-cocycle. \(L\) (viewed as a vector space over itself) can be endowed with an action of \(L\rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\) such that \(xg\cdot 1_{L}=x\varphi(g)\) for all \(x\in L\), \(g\in G\) where \(1_{L}\in L\) is the multiplicative identity; write \(N\) for the \(L\rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\)-module corresponding to this action. Endow \(L\) with the trivial \(L\rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\)-module structure. By the previous discussion, there is an isomorphism \(u:L\longrightarrow N\) of \(L\rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\)-modules. Set \(\psi:=u\circ{1_{L}}\); then \(d^{\ast}_{1}\circ \psi=\xi(\varphi)\), as desired.</span></span></div></div><p>This already has arithmetic applications. For example, the problem of counting rational points on the one-dimensional torus \(\mathbf{T}:=\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}=1\}\) reduces to applying the above theorem to the extension \(L/K=\mathbf{Q}\left(i\right)/\mathbf{Q}\). Indeed, if \((x,y)\in\mathbf{Q}^{2}\cap\mathbf{T}\) it must be that $$N(x+iy):=\prod_{\sigma\in\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)}\sigma(x+iy)=1$$ since the only non-trivial element of \(\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\) is \(x+iy\longmapsto x-iy\). Each element of \(L^{\times}\) can be identified with a function from \(\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\) to \(L^{\times}\), and a routine calculation yields that \(N(x+iy)=1\) implies \(x+iy\) is in the kernel of \(d^{\ast}_{2}\). By Hilbert's theorem 90, there exists \(z\in L^{\times}\) such that \(d^{\ast}_{1}(z)=x+iy\); note that \(d^{\ast}_{1}(z)=\left(\sigma\longmapsto\frac{z}{\sigma(z)}\right)\). Denote by \(\sigma\) the non-trivial element of \(\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\). Then<span class="equation"><span class="eqn">$$x+iy=\frac{\mathfrak{Re}(z)+i\mathfrak{Im}(z)}{\sigma(\mathfrak{Re}(z)+i\mathfrak{Im}(z))}=\frac{\mathfrak{Re}(z)+i\mathfrak{Im}(z)}{\mathfrak{Re}(z)-\mathfrak{Im}(z)i}=\frac{\mathfrak{Re}(z)^{2}-\mathfrak{Im}(z)^{2}}{\mathfrak{Re}(z)^{2}+\mathfrak{Im}(z)^{2}}+\frac{2\mathfrak{Re}(z)\mathfrak{Im}(z)}{\mathfrak{Re}(z)^{2}+\mathfrak{Im}(z)^{2}}i$$</span></span>which implies the following characterization of the rational points of \(\mathbf{T}\): a pair \((x,y)\) of rational numbers satisfies \(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\) only if there exists integers \(p,q\in\mathbf{Z}\) such that <span class="equation"><span class="eqn">$$(x,y)=\left(\frac{p^{2}-q^{2}}{p^{2}+q^{2}},\frac{2pq}{p^{2}+q^{2}}\right).$$</span></span> Indeed, notice the expression for \(x+iy\) in terms of \(\mathfrak{Re}(z)\) and \(\mathfrak{Im}(z)\) remains invariant after scaling the rational numbers \(\mathfrak{Re}(z)\) and \(\mathfrak{Im}(z)\) by the same amount; thus, one may assume \(\mathfrak{Re}(z)\) and \(\mathfrak{Im}(z)\) are integers (multiply by a common denominator).</p></div></div>
