Then \(K\) is either a finite extension of \(\mathbf{Q}\), or the function field of a smooth, projective curve \(C\) over \(\mathbb{F}_{q}\). I will assume the latter. The Riemann hypothesis for the function field of \(C\) is then the inequality $$\vert{N_{r}-(1+q^{r})}\vert\leq 2g\sqrt{q^{r}}$$ where \(N_{r}\) is the number of points of \(C\) over the field extension \(\mathbb{F}_{q^{r}}\). This is different from the usual formulation in which the Riemann hypothesis is viewed as a statement about the zeta function \(\zeta_{C}\) associated to \(C\).</p><p>To this end, let \(C\) be a smooth, projective, curve over \(\mathbb{F}_{q}\). For the needs of intersection theory, it is necessary to extend \(C\) to an algebraic closure; thus, let $$\bar{C}:=\mathrm{Spec}\left(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}\right)\times_{\mathrm{Spec}\left(\mathbb{F}_{q}\right)}C$$ where \(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}\) is the algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{F}_{q}\). Define the Frobenius automorphism \(F\in\mathrm{Gal}\left({\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}/\mathbb{F}_{q}}\right)\) to be the map \(x\longmapsto x^{q}\). The scheme-theoretic version of \(F\) is the relative Frobenius \(F_{R}:=I\times F_{A}\) on \(\bar{C}\) where \(F_{A}\) is the absolute Frobenius (the identity on points of the scheme and the \(q\)-th power map in the structure sheaf). Indeed, this coincides with the following intuitive definition for the affine line: the relative Frobenius is the morphism of schemes corresponding (under the usual contravariant equivalence \(\mathbf{CRing}\simeq\mathbf{AffSch}\)) to the ring homomorphism $$\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}[x]\longrightarrow\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}[x],x\longmapsto x^{q}.$$ Let \(X:=\bar{C}\times\bar{C}\), let \(\Delta\subset X\) be the diagonal, and let \(\Gamma_{r}\subset X\) be the graph of \(F^{r}_{R}\).</p><p>Let \(\mathrm{Pic}(X)\) be the Picard group of \(X\), which is the additive group of divisors modulo principal divisors. Recall there is a bilinear map  \(\cdot:\mathrm{Pic}(X)\oplus\mathrm{Pic}(X)\longrightarrow\mathbf{Z}\) such that if smooth curves \(D\) and \(D'\) intersect transversely $$D\cdot D'=\vert{D\cap D'}\vert.$$ Since \(\Delta\) and \(\Gamma_{r}\) are smooth and intersect transversely, one has the equality \(N_{r}=\Delta\cdot \Gamma_{r}\). This suggests the application of intersection theory to proving the Riemann hypothesis.</p><div class="thm"><strong>Lemma (Hodge index theorem). </strong>Let \(D,D'\in\mathrm{Pic}(X)\) be such that \(D'\cdot D'>0\) and \(D\cdot D'=0\). Then \(D\cdot D\leq0\).</div><div class="prf"><strong>Proof. </strong>The proof is split into three parts.<p>Denote by \(\omega_{X}\) the canonical divisor of \(X\). Let \(\mathscr{L}\) and \(\mathscr{M}\) be invertible sheaves with \(\mathscr{M}\) ample; suppose \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}>\omega_{X}\cdot\mathscr{M}\). I claim \(h^{2}(X,\mathscr{L})=0\). Indeed, by Serre duality it suffices to show \(h^{0}(X,\omega_{X}\otimes\mathscr{L}^{\vee})=0\). If this did not hold, \(\omega_{X}\otimes\mathscr{L}^{\vee}\) would have a nonzero section; the Nakai-Moishezon theorem implies (in additive notation) \((\omega_{X}-\mathscr{L})\cdot\mathscr{M}\geq0\), contradicting \(\mathscr{M}\cdot\mathscr{L}>\omega_{X}\cdot\mathscr{M}\).</p><p>Suppose now that \(\mathscr{M}\) is ample, and \(\mathscr{L}\) is any invertible sheaf with \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{L}>0\) and \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}>0\). I will show there exists an \(N\) such that \(m\geq{N}\) implies \(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m}\) has a section. Notice the equality $$\mathscr{L}^{\otimes n}\cdot\mathscr{M}=n\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}$$ for any \(n\). Define \(n\) to be the smallest natural number such that \(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes n}\cdot\mathscr{M}>\omega_{X}\cdot\mathscr{M}\) with such a number existing by the above equality combined with the inequality \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}>0\). The result of the previous paragraph implies \(h^{2}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})=0\) for all \(m\geq n\). Then, for \(m\geq{n}\) $$h^{0}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})-h^{1}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})=\chi(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})=\frac{m^{2}}{2}\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{L}-\frac{1}{2}m\mathscr{L}\cdot\omega_{X}+\chi(X,\mathscr{O}_{X})$$ by the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. By assumption, \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{L}>0\) so the right-hand side of the above equality is positive for all \(m\) greater than or equal to some number \(N\geq n\); this implies \(h^{0}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})\geq h^{0}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})-h^{1}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})\) for \(m\geq{N}\), as desired.</p><p>Assume \(\mathscr{M}\) is ample, \(\mathscr{L}\) is an invertible sheaf, \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{L}>0\), and \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}=0\). There is an \(n\) such that for all \(m\geq{n}\), \(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m}\otimes\mathscr{M}:=\mathscr{F}_{m}\) is very ample. Then \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{F}_{m}>0\); thus, the previous paragraph implies \(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m}\) is effective. This combined with Nakai-Moishezon implies \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}=\frac{1}{m}\mathscr{L}^{\otimes{m}}\cdot\mathscr{M}>0\), a contradiction. The Hodge index theorem follows from applying these results to \(\mathscr{L}:=\mathscr{O}_{X}(D)\), \(\mathscr{M}:=\mathscr{O}_{X}(M)\). This concludes the proof.</p></div></div></div>
