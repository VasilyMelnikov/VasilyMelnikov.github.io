Then \(K\) is either a finite extension of \(\mathbf{Q}\), or the function field of a smooth, projective curve \(C\) over \(\mathbb{F}_{q}\). I will assume the latter. The Riemann hypothesis for the function field of \(C\) is then the inequality $$\vert{N_{r}-(1+q^{r})}\vert\leq 2g\sqrt{q^{r}}$$ where \(g\) is the genus of \(C\) and \(N_{r}\) is the number of points of \(C\) over the field extension \(\mathbb{F}_{q^{r}}\). This is different from the usual formulation in which the Riemann hypothesis is viewed as a statement about the zeta function \(\zeta_{C}\) associated to \(C\).</p><p>To this end, let \(C\) be a smooth, projective, curve over \(\mathbb{F}_{q}\). For the needs of intersection theory, it is necessary to extend \(C\) to an algebraic closure; thus, let $$\bar{C}:=\mathrm{Spec}\left(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}\right)\times_{\mathrm{Spec}\left(\mathbb{F}_{q}\right)}C$$ where \(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}\) is the algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{F}_{q}\). Define the Frobenius automorphism \(F\in\mathrm{Gal}\left({\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}/\mathbb{F}_{q}}\right)\) to be the map \(x\longmapsto x^{q}\). The scheme-theoretic version of \(F\) is the relative Frobenius \(F_{R}:=I\times F_{A}\) on \(\bar{C}\) where \(F_{A}\) is the absolute Frobenius (the identity on points of the scheme and the \(q\)-th power map in the structure sheaf). Indeed, this coincides with the following intuitive definition for the affine line: the relative Frobenius is the morphism of schemes corresponding (under the usual contravariant equivalence \(\mathbf{CRing}\simeq\mathbf{AffSch}\)) to the ring homomorphism $$\varphi:\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}[x]\longrightarrow\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}[x],$$ $$\varphi(x)=x^{q}.$$ Let \(X:=\bar{C}\times\bar{C}\), let \(\Delta\subset X\) be the diagonal, and let \(\Gamma_{r}\subset X\) be the graph of \(F^{r}_{R}\).</p><p>Let \(\mathrm{Pic}(X)\) be the Picard group of \(X\), which is the additive group of divisors modulo principal divisors. Recall there is a bilinear map  \(\cdot:\mathrm{Pic}(X)\oplus\mathrm{Pic}(X)\longrightarrow\mathbf{Z}\) such that if smooth curves \(D\) and \(D'\) intersect transversely $$D\cdot D'=\vert{D\cap D'}\vert.$$ Since \(\Delta\) and \(\Gamma_{r}\) are smooth and intersect transversely, one has the equality \(N_{r}=\Delta\cdot \Gamma_{r}\). This suggests the application of intersection theory to proving the Riemann hypothesis.</p><div class="thm"><div><strong>Lemma (Hodge index theorem). </strong>Let \(D,D'\in\mathrm{Pic}(X)\) be such that \(D'\cdot D'>0\) and \(D\cdot D'=0\). Then \(D\cdot D\leq0\).</div></div><div class="prf"><div><strong>Proof. </strong>The proof is split into three parts.<p>Denote by \(\omega_{X}\) the canonical divisor of \(X\). Let \(\mathscr{L}\) and \(\mathscr{M}\) be invertible sheaves with \(\mathscr{M}\) ample; suppose \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}>\omega_{X}\cdot\mathscr{M}\). I claim \(h^{2}(X,\mathscr{L})=0\). Indeed, by Serre duality it suffices to show \(h^{0}(X,\omega_{X}\otimes\mathscr{L}^{\vee})=0\). If this did not hold, \(\omega_{X}\otimes\mathscr{L}^{\vee}\) would have a nonzero section; the Nakai-Moishezon theorem implies (in additive notation) \((\omega_{X}-\mathscr{L})\cdot\mathscr{M}\geq0\), contradicting \(\mathscr{M}\cdot\mathscr{L}>\omega_{X}\cdot\mathscr{M}\).</p><p>Suppose now that \(\mathscr{M}\) is ample, and \(\mathscr{L}\) is any invertible sheaf with \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{L}>0\) and \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}>0\). I will show there exists an \(N\) such that \(m\geq{N}\) implies \(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m}\) has a section. Notice the equality $$\mathscr{L}^{\otimes n}\cdot\mathscr{M}=n\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}$$ for any \(n\). Define \(n\) to be the smallest natural number such that \(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes n}\cdot\mathscr{M}>\omega_{X}\cdot\mathscr{M}\) with such a number existing by the above equality combined with the inequality \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}>0\). The result of the previous paragraph implies \(h^{2}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})=0\) for all \(m\geq n\). Then, for \(m\geq{n}\) $$h^{0}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})-h^{1}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})=\chi(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})=\frac{m^{2}}{2}\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{L}-\frac{1}{2}m\mathscr{L}\cdot\omega_{X}+\chi(X,\mathscr{O}_{X})$$ by the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. By assumption, \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{L}>0\) so the right-hand side of the above equality is positive for all \(m\) greater than or equal to some number \(N\geq n\); this implies \(h^{0}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})\geq h^{0}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})-h^{1}(X,\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m})\) for \(m\geq{N}\), as desired.</p><p>Assume \(\mathscr{M}\) is ample, \(\mathscr{L}\) is an invertible sheaf, \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{L}>0\), and \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}=0\). There is an \(n\) such that for all \(m\geq{n}\), \(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m}\otimes\mathscr{M}:=\mathscr{F}_{m}\) is very ample. Then \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{F}_{m}>0\); thus, the previous paragraph implies \(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes m}\) is effective. This combined with Nakai-Moishezon implies \(\mathscr{L}\cdot\mathscr{M}=\frac{1}{m}\mathscr{L}^{\otimes{m}}\cdot\mathscr{M}>0\), a contradiction. The Hodge index theorem follows from applying these results to \(\mathscr{L}:=\mathscr{O}_{X}(D)\), \(\mathscr{M}:=\mathscr{O}_{X}(M)\). This concludes the proof.</p></div></div><p>One might ask why the above theorem is an "index theorem". If one extends the bilinear map \((D,D')\longmapsto D\cdot D'\) to the \(\mathbf{Q}\)-vector space \(\mathbf{Q}\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}\mathrm{Pic}(X)\), then one can view the Hodge index theorem as a statement about the signature (sometimes referred to as the index) of this extension (c.f. Sylvesterâ€™s law of inertia).</p><div class="thm"><div><strong>Theorem (Riemann hypothesis). </strong>RH.</div></div><div class="prf"><div class="form"><a><strong>Proof. </strong>Let \(x:=\ast\times\bar{C}\), \(y=\bar{C}\times\ast\). I claim the inequality $$D\cdot D\leq 2(x\cdot D)(y\cdot D)$$ holds for any divisor \(D\); this is the Castelnuovo-Severi inequality. Define \(\mathrm{def}(D):=2(x\cdot D)(y\cdot D)-D\cdot D\). I claim the inequality $$\vert{D\cdot D'-(x\cdot D)(y\cdot D')-(x\cdot D')(y\cdot D)}\vert\leq\sqrt{\mathrm{def}(D)\mathrm{def}(D')}$$ holds for any divisors \(D\) and \(D'\). Indeed, expand out \(\mathrm{def}(nD+mD')\geq 0\) for \(n,m\in\mathbf{Z}\); one can let \(\frac{n}{m}\) get arbitrarily close to \(\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{def}(D')}{\mathrm{def}(D)}}\), yielding the inequality. Notice that \(\mathrm{def}(\Gamma_{r})=2gq^{r}\), \(\mathrm{def}(\Delta)=2g\) (c.f. adjunction formula); thus, one has $$\vert{N_{r}-q^{r}-1}\vert=\vert{N_{r}-(y\cdot \Gamma_{r})-(x\cdot \Gamma_{r})}\vert=\vert{\Delta\cdot \Gamma_{r}-(x\cdot \Delta)(y\cdot \Gamma_{r})-(x\cdot \Gamma_{r})(y\cdot \Delta)}\vert\leq\sqrt{\mathrm{def}(\Delta)\mathrm{def}(\Gamma_{r})}=\sqrt{4g^{2}q^{r}}=2g\sqrt{q^{r}}$$ as desired.</a></div></div><p>A natural question is whether this proof - or at least ideas from the proof - can be used to prove the actual Riemann hypothesis. A theory that partially answers this question is Arakelov geometry, which builds on the similarity of function fields to number fields. The idea is to compactify (thereby adding a point at infinity) the affine scheme \(\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})\), and then view it as a projective curve over something like a finite field; this object is typically taken to be the field with one element (this name is a misnomer since every field must contain at least two elements). Unfortunately, it is not clear how to proceed. Indeed, the key elements for the proof presented here (Serre duality, sheaf cohomology, Riemann-Roch, and intersection theory on \(\bar{C}\times\bar{C}\)) do not have a clear counterpart in the context of Arakelov theory.</p></div></div>
