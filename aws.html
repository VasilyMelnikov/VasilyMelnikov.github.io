Here \(H\) is a real, separable Hilbert space, \(E\) is a real, separable Banach space with norm \(q\), and $$j:H\longrightarrow E$$ is a continuous linear injection with dense range such that the pullback of \(q\) to \(H\) is Gross-measurable. A fundamental result, first due to L. Gross, implies that there exists a Radon probability measure \( \mu:\mathscr{B}(E)\longrightarrow[0,\infty] \) such that $$\mathbf{E}\left(\varphi\left(j'x'_{1},\dots,j'x'_{n}\right)\right)=\int_{E}\varphi\left(x'_{1},\dots,x'_{n}\right)d\mu$$ for every finite subset \( \{x'_{1},\dots,x'_{n}\}\subset E' \) and every Borel-measurable function \(\varphi:\mathbf{R}^{n}\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}\) where \(\mathbf{E}\) denotes expectation with respect to the canonical Gauss measure. The canonical Gauss measure may be formally characterized as a Gaussian probability measure whose covariance operator is the identity; such a measure does not exist unless \(H\) is finite-dimensional. To remedy this problem, it is necessary to change the domain of definition to the cylindrical subsets, i.e. inverse images of finite-dimensional projections. Denoting by \(P_{K}\) the projection onto a finite-dimensional subspace \(K\simeq \mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(K)}\) one defines $$\gamma(C)=\gamma_{\mathrm{dim}(K)}(C_{0})$$ where \(C=P^{-1}_{K}(C_{0})\), \(C_{0}\) is a Borel subset of \(\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(K)}\), and \(\gamma_{\mathrm{dim}(K)}:\mathscr{B}(\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(K)})\longrightarrow[0,\infty]\) is the canonical Gauss measure on \(\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(K)}\). Even on the cylindrical subsets it fails to be \(\sigma\)-additive. Thankfully \(\mathbf{E}\) is well defined (\(\mathbf{E}\) is allowed to take values in the one-point compactification of \(\mathbf{R}\) in case of integrability issues) on the space of measurable functions factoring through a finite-dimensional subspace. This means (at least formally) $$\mu(dh)=Z^{-1}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\langle{h,h}\rangle\right)dh$$ for some normalization constant \(Z\) where the above expression is purely formal since \(dh\) is an invariant measure for the group of translations of \(H\) which can be shown not to exist, and \(\mu(H)=0\). The importance of these informal expressions lies in the fact that nonexistent measures like \(dh\) often appear in the physics literature - most notably in R. Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.</div></div>
