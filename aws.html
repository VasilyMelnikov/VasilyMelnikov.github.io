Here \(H\) is a real, separable Hilbert space, \(E\) is a real, separable Banach space with norm \(q\), and $$j:H\longrightarrow E$$ is a continuous linear injection with dense range such that the pullback of \(q\) to \(H\) is Gross-measurable. A fundamental result, first due to L. Gross, implies that there exists a Radon probability measure \( \mu:\mathscr{B}(E)\longrightarrow[0,\infty] \) such that $$\mathbf{E}\left(\varphi\left(j'x'_{1},\dots,j'x'_{n}\right)\right)=\int_{E}\varphi\left(x'_{1},\dots,x'_{n}\right)d\mu$$ for every finite subset \( \{x'_{1},\dots,x'_{n}\}\subset E' \) and every Borel-measurable function \(\varphi:\mathbf{R}^{n}\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}\) where \(\mathbf{E}\) denotes expectation with respect to the canonical Gauss measure. The canonical Gauss measure may be formally characterized as a Gaussian probability measure whose covariance operator is the identity; such a measure does not exist unless \(H\) is finite-dimensional. To remedy this problem, it is necessary to change the domain of definition to the cylindrical subsets, i.e. inverse images of finite-dimensional projections. Denoting by \(P_{K}\) the projection onto a finite-dimensional subspace \(K\simeq \mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(K)}\) one defines $$\gamma(C)=\gamma_{\mathrm{dim}(K)}(C_{0})$$ where \(C=P^{-1}_{K}(C_{0})\), \(C_{0}\) is a Borel subset of \(\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(K)}\), and \(\gamma_{\mathrm{dim}(K)}:\mathscr{B}(\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(K)})\longrightarrow[0,\infty]\) is the canonical Gauss measure on \(\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(K)}\). Even on the cylindrical subsets it fails to be \(\sigma\)-additive. Thankfully \(\mathbf{E}\) is well defined (\(\mathbf{E}\) is allowed to take values in a compactification of \(\mathbf{R}\) in case of integrability issues) on the space of measurable functions factoring through a finite-dimensional subspace. This means (at least formally) $$\mu(dh)=Z^{-1}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\langle{h,h}\rangle\right)dh$$ for some normalization constant \(Z\) where the above expression is purely formal since \(dh\) is an invariant measure for the group of translations of \(H\) which can be shown not to exist, and \(\mu\) is defined on a larger space (in fact, \(\mu(H)=0\)). Indeed, the above expression behaves under translation exactly like it would under the Cameron-Martin theorem. The importance of these informal expressions lies in the fact that nonexistent measures like \(dh\) often appear in the physics literature - most notably in R. Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.<p>Let \(H^{1}([0,1])\) be the Sobolev space of order one on \([0,1]\). The Poincaré inequality implies the norm \(h\longmapsto\Vert{h'}\Vert_{L^{2}}\) is equivalent to the usual \(H^{1}\)-norm. By Sobolev embedding theory, \(H^{1}([0,1])\) embeds into the space \(C([0,1])\) of continuous functions on \([0,1]\) (with the \(L^{\infty}\)-norm); denote by \(\ell\) this embedding. Let \(\delta_{x}\) be the Dirac measure centered at \(x\in[0,1]\), which defines a linear functional on \(C([0,1])\). Let \(g:=\ell'\delta_{0}\). Since \(g\) is continuous, \(H:=\mathrm{ker}(g)\) is closed and inherits the Hilbert space structure of \(H^{1}([0,1])\); similarly, \(E:=\mathrm{ker}(\delta_{0})\) is closed and inherits the Banach space structure of \(C([0,1])\). Denote by \(q\) the norm of \(E\), and \(j\) the canonical inclusion map from \(H\) to \(E\).</p><div class="thm"><div class="form"><span><strong>Theorem. </strong>The triple \((H,j,E)\) is an abstract Wiener space.</span></div></div><div class="prf"><div class="form"><span><strong>Proof. </strong>Assuming the existence of the Wiener measure \(\mu\) (the law of Brownian motion) on \(E\), this is more or less straightforward; indeed, \(H\) is the Cameron-Martin space (c.f. Girsanov theorem, an analogue of the abstract Cameron-Martin theorem for the classical Wiener space) of the Wiener measure.</span></div></div><p>The Minkowski metric $$ds^{2}=-dt^{2}+dx^{2}$$ is equivalent to the Euclidean metric $$ds^{2}=dt^{2}+dx^{2}$$ if one allows the time coordinate to take imaginary values; one such equivalence is given by the Wick rotation \(w:=\left(t\longmapsto\frac{1}{\sqrt{-1}}t\right)\). Let \(S:H\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}\) be the free (i.e. zero potential) Euclidean action functional \(h\longmapsto\frac{m}{2}\Vert{h'}\Vert_{L^{2}}\). The Wick rotation \(w\) transforms the (mathematically ill-defined) path integral equation $$\psi=\left((t,x)\longmapsto\int_{H}\exp\left(-\sqrt{-1}S(h)/\hbar\right)\psi_{0}(x+j'\delta_{t}h)dh\right)$$ where \(\psi_{0}\) is the initial condition into the (still mathematically ill-defined) path integral equation $$\psi=\left((t,x)\longmapsto\int_{H}\exp\left(-S(h)/\hbar\right)\psi_{0}(x+j'\delta_{t}h)dh\right).$$ However there is still hope that the above expression should have a mathematically rigorous interpretation. Indeed, \(S\) is quadratic so \(\exp\left(-S(h)/\hbar\right)dh\) should define some kind of Gaussian measure. By the previous discussion on expressions of this form, one concludes that it should be the Wiener measure (potentially with a different variance parameter); thus, the rigorous interpretation of \(\psi\) is viewing it as an expectation with respect to the Wiener measure \(\mu\). The Feynman-Kac theorem implies \(\psi\) satisfies the Wick-rotated version of the Schrödinger equation. Thus R. Feynman's unrigorous path integrals can be made rigorous and provide an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics.</p></div></div>
