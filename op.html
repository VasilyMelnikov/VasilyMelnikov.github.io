Some examples include rings of matrices closed under taking adjoints, or any commutative ring equipped with the identity map. A \(\ast\)-algebra \(A\) over a \(\ast\)-ring \(R\) is a \(\ast\)-ring which is also an associative algebra over \(R\), and is such that \((rx)^{\ast}=r'x^{\ast}\) for all \(r\in{R}\), \(x\in{A}\) where \(r\longmapsto r'\) denotes the involution operation on \(R\).<div class="def"><div class="form"><span><strong>Definition. </strong>A \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra is a complex Banach space \(A\) with the structure of a \(\ast\)-algebra over \(\mathbf{C}\) satisfying $$\Vert{xx^{\ast}}\Vert=\Vert{x}\Vert\Vert{x^{\ast}}\Vert$$ $$\Vert{xy}\Vert\leq\Vert{x}\Vert\Vert{y}\Vert$$ where \(\Vert\cdot\Vert\) denotes the norm of \(A\). A morphism of \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras is a linear map between two \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras which preserves involution and multiplication; a \(C^{\ast}\)-morphism is an isomorphism if it is bijective.</span></div></div><p>Some examples of \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras include the algebra \(\mathscr{L}(H)\) of bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space \(H\), or the space \(C(X)\) of complex-valued continuous functions on a compact space \(X\). In the former case, the involution is the adjoint map. In the latter case, the involution is obtained by taking complex conjugates pointwise. It turns out that both of these examples are universal in some sense: every isomorphism class of unital commutative \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras is isomorphic to \(C(X)\) for some unique (up to homeomorphism) compact space \(X\), while every \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra embeds into \(\mathscr{L}(H)\) for some complex Hilbert space \(H\).</p><div class="thm"><div class="form"><span><strong>Theorem (Gelfand duality). </strong>Let \(A\) be a commutative unital \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra. Every element of the \(C^{\ast}\)-isomorphism class of \(A\) is isometrically \(C^{\ast}\)-isomorphic to \(C(X)\) for a unique (up to homeomorphism) compact space \(X\).</span></div></div><div class="prf"><div class="form"><span><strong>Lemma (Hodge index theorem). </strong>Let \(D,D'\in\mathrm{Pic}(X)\) be such that \(D'\cdot D'>0\) and \(D\cdot D'=0\).
