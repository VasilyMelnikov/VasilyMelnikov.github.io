Some examples include rings of matrices closed under taking adjoints, or any commutative ring equipped with the identity map. A \(\ast\)-algebra \(A\) over a \(\ast\)-ring \(R\) is a \(\ast\)-ring which is also an associative algebra over \(R\), and is such that \((rx)^{\ast}=r'x^{\ast}\) for all \(r\in{R}\), \(x\in{A}\) where \(r\longmapsto r'\) denotes the involution operation on \(R\).<div class="def"><div class="form"><span><strong>Definition. </strong>A \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra is a complex Banach space \(A\) with the structure of a \(\ast\)-algebra over \(\mathbf{C}\) satisfying $$\Vert{xx^{\ast}}\Vert=\Vert{x}\Vert\Vert{x^{\ast}}\Vert$$ $$\Vert{xy}\Vert\leq\Vert{x}\Vert\Vert{y}\Vert$$ where \(\Vert\cdot\Vert\) denotes the norm of \(A\). A morphism of \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras is a linear map between two \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras which preserves involution and multiplication; a \(C^{\ast}\)-morphism is an isomorphism if it is bijective.</span></div></div><p>Some examples of \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras include the algebra \(\mathscr{L}(H)\) of bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space \(H\), or the space \(C(X)\) of complex-valued continuous functions on a compact space \(X\). In the former case, the involution is the adjoint map. In the latter case, the involution is obtained by taking complex conjugates pointwise. It turns out that both of these examples are universal in some sense: every isomorphism class of unital commutative \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras is isomorphic to \(C(X)\) for some unique (up to homeomorphism) compact space \(X\), while every \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra embeds into \(\mathscr{L}(H)\) for some complex Hilbert space \(H\).</p><div class="thm"><div class="form"><span><strong>Theorem (Gelfand duality). </strong>Let \(A\) be a commutative unital \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra. Then \(A\) is \(C^{\ast}\)-isomorphic to \(C(X)\) for a unique (up to homeomorphism) compact space \(X\).</span></div></div><div class="prf"><div class="form"><span><strong>Proof. </strong>Let \(e\) be the identity for multiplication. Define the spectrum \(\mathrm{Spec}(A)\) of \(A\) to be the set of characters on \(A\); a character \(\chi\) on \(A\) is a non-zero algebra homomorphism \(\chi:{A}\longrightarrow\mathbf{C}\).<p>I claim \(\mathrm{Spec}({A})\) is a subset of the unit ball in \(A'\); in particular, each character is continuous. Suppose there is an \(x\in{A}\) and \(\chi\in\mathrm{Spec}({A})\) with \(\vert\chi(x)\vert>\Vert{x}\Vert\). Then \(y:=\chi(x)^{-1}x\) has norm strictly less than one, and \(z:=e-y\) is invertible; indeed, \(z^{-1}\) is the Neumann series $$z^{-1}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}y^{n}.$$ Notice then that $$\chi(\chi(x)z)=\chi(x)\chi(e)-\chi(x)$$ $$=\chi(x)-\chi(x)=0$$ forcing \(1=\chi(1)=\chi(zz^{-1})=\chi(z)\chi(z^{-1})=0\), a clear contradiction.</p><span>By Banach-Alaoglu and continuity of multiplication, \(\mathrm{Spec}({A})\) is \(\sigma({A}',{A})\)-compact; equip \(\mathrm{Spec}({A})\) with the subspace topology. I claim \({A}\) is isometrically \(C^{\ast}\)-isomorphic to \(C(\mathrm{Spec}({A}))\), and if any other topological space \(X\) has this property, then \(\mathrm{Spec}({A})\) is homeomorphic to \(X\). The latter follows from Banach-Stone. For the former, let \(\varphi:{A}\longrightarrow C(\mathrm{Spec}({A}))\) be the map \(x\longmapsto(\chi\longmapsto\chi(x))\). That it is a morphism of \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras is obvious; to show it is an isometry, one can use the spectral radius formula. The isometry property implies \(\varphi\) is injective, and that \(\varphi({A})\) separates points in \(\mathrm{Spec}({A})\). The complex Stone-Weierstrass theorem implies \(\varphi(\mathrm{Spec}({A}))\) is dense in \(C(\mathrm{Spec}({A}))\); since isometries are closed, \(\varphi({A})=C(\mathrm{Spec}({A}))\).</span></span></div></div><p>It is also possible to extend the above theorem to locally compact spaces. With this extension, one can turn topological/geometric constructions into algebraic constructions. For example, the one-point compactification functor corresponds to unitalization of the corresponding \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra, while the Stone–Čech compactification functor corresponds to the multiplier algebra construction. In fact, the category of commutative \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras is equivalent to \(\mathbf{LCHTop}^{op}\) (opposite category of the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces). One might then ask if there is a similar characterization for general \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras. Unfortunately, this goal is too optimistic. However, one can characterize a general \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra as an operator algebra - showing that operator algebras are, in a certain sense, a generalization of classical topology. Before one can prove this, it is necessary to endow \(A\) with an order structure; let \(A_{+}:=\{x^{\ast}x:x\in{A}\}\), and write \(x\geq y\) if \(x-y\in A_{+}\). A linear functional \(x'\in{A'}\) is said to be positive if \(x'(A_{+})\subset\{z^{\ast}z:z\in\mathbf{C}\}\). Write \(A'_{+}\) for the cone of positive linear functionals.</p><div class="def"><div class="form"><span><strong>Definition. </strong>A cyclic representation of \(A\) on a complex Hilbert space \(H\) is a \(C^{\ast}\)-morphism \(\pi:A\longrightarrow \mathscr{L}(H)\) such that there exists \(\xi\in{H}\) with dense orbit (i.e. \(\pi(A)\xi\) is dense in \(H\)). One writes \((H,\pi,\xi)\) for the cyclic representation \(\pi\) to indicate the additional data.</span></div></div><div class="thm"><div class="form"><span><strong>Theorem (Gelfand–Naimark–Segal). </strong>Let \(x'\in A'_{+}\) be such that \(\Vert{x'}\Vert_{A'}=1\). There is a cyclic representation \((H,\pi,\xi)\) such that $$\langle{\pi(x)\xi,\xi}\rangle=x'(x)$$ for every \(x\in H\) where \(\langle{\cdot,\cdot}\rangle\) is the inner product on \(H\).</span></div></div><div class="prf"><div class="form"><span><strong>Proof. </strong>Assume \(A\) is unital with multiplicative identity \(e\). Let \(Q:{A}\longrightarrow\mathbf{C}\) be the bilinear form \((x,y)\longmapsto x'(y^{\ast}x)\). Define the "left kernel" of \(Q\) to be the left ideal \(M\subset A\) defined as the kernel of the pullback of \(Q\) to the diagonal. Define an inner product on \(A/M\) by \(\langle{x+M,y+M}\rangle:=Q(x,y)\). The Cauchy completion of \(A/M\) with respect to this inner product is a Hilbert space, which I denote by \(H\). For \(x\in A\) and \(y+M\in A/M\), define the linear operator \(p(x)\) by \(p(x)(y+M)=xy+M\). Since this is bounded on \(A/M\), it extends to a bounded linear operator on \(H\), which I denote by \(\pi(x)\). Set \(\xi:=\ell(e+I)\) where \(\ell:A/M\longrightarrow H\) is the canonical embedding. Then \(\xi\) is easily seen to have dense orbit and $$\langle{\pi(x)\xi,\xi}\rangle=Q(x,e)=x'(x)$$ as desired. I leave the extension to non-unital \(C^{\ast}\)-algebras to the reader.</span></div></div><p>The above theorem allows one to embed any \(C^{\ast}\)-algebra \(A\) into \(\mathscr{L}(H)\) for some Hilbert space \(H\). Indeed, let \(B\) be the collection of \(x'\in A'_{+}\) with \(\Vert{x'}\Vert_{A'}=1\); for \(x'\in B\), define \((H_{x'},\pi_{x'},\xi_{x'})\) to be the cyclic representation whose existence is guaranteed by the above the above theorem. Let \(H\) be the Hilbert space direct sum $$H=\bigoplus_{x'\in B}H_{x'}.$$ Then the direct sum representation \(\pi:=\bigoplus_{x'\in B} \pi_{x'}\) is injective. The representation \(\pi\) is called the universal representation of \(A\).</p></div></div>
